# Pre-Algebra Resources



**What's included in the Pre-Algebra Resources section:**

1. **Videos and Interactive Lessons**: This section includes five links to interactive lessons created from YouTube videos. These lessons cover various pre-algebra topics such as finding the area of composite figures, understanding volume measurement, understanding the meaning of percent, and visualizing equivalent fractions. The lessons are interactive, meaning they provide a more engaging learning experience than just watching a video.

2. **Flashcards**: This section includes two links to sets of flashcards on Quizlet. The first set is a vocabulary study set specifically for 8th grade pre-algebra students. The second set is a general pre-algebra flashcard set. These flashcards can be used to review and reinforce understanding of pre-algebra vocabulary and concepts.

The resources are all linked to Roshi, an online platform that allows users to create, share, and learn from interactive lessons. The links provided will take you directly to the interactive lessons or flashcards. 

This collection of resources provides a comprehensive guide to pre-algebra concepts, offering both video content for visual and auditory learners, and flashcards for quick review and reinforcement.
